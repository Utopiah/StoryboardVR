Dive in your drawings, explain to 3D artists your vision then iterate.

![Interface example with live collaboration](http://vatelier.net/MyDemo/Storyboard/preview.jpg)

## How can I use it
- visit [the viewer](http://vatelier.net/MyDemo/Storyboard/) , look around
- put the cursor on the green plane to refresh content, assuming you or somebody else saved a new image
- put the cursor on the red plane to jump to the next scene or room, assuming you made more than one
- edit the content using [the editor](http://vatelier.net/MyDemo/Storyboard/Editor/) or [editor for 2nd room](http://vatelier.net/MyDemo/Storyboard/EditorRoom2/)
See for details [see the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNr7xdc69fU).

## ToDo
- complete editor to do all 6 pannels
- handle N rooms, not just 2
- offer storyboard down, all rooms with all pannels
- URL per session to avoid overwrite (currently backing up per unix timestamp)
- first room as rewritable tutorial
- get notification on texture update then offer refresh
- option for automatic refresh e.g. once per second
- in VR drawing on canvas
- adding elements with position as texture on cubes
- use [buildSceneFromCanvas()](http://www.loganfamily.karoo.net/logo/index.html) and get a goemetry back e.g. draw a height map, get a world back
